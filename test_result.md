# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## user_problem_statement: |
  Complete Real-time WebRTC Multi-Object Detection (Phone → Browser → Inference → Overlay)
  Build a reproducible demo that streams the phone camera to a browser via WebRTC, performs multi-object detection, and overlays bounding boxes in near real-time. Provide both Server and WASM low-resource modes.
  
  Hard Requirements:
  - Phone only (no app): Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS). Show a QR code and short URL to join.
  - WebRTC pipeline: getUserMedia → RTCPeerConnection; render the remote track; Canvas overlay for boxes; DataChannel (or WebSocket) to deliver detection JSON.
  - Dual inference modes: Server mode (Python aiortc + ONNX Runtime CPU) and WASM mode (low-resource required)
  - Backpressure: fixed-length frame queue; drop old frames; adaptive thinning/rate.
  - Metrics & bench (30s): compute and write metrics.json with E2E latency, Server latency, Network latency, Processed FPS, bandwidth estimate
  - Mode switch & connectivity: MODE=server|wasm env; ./start.sh launches everything; --ngrok flag publishes a phone-reachable URL.
  - Deliverables: Git repo with Dockerfile(s), docker-compose.yml, start.sh, ./bench/run_bench.sh, README, Loom video
